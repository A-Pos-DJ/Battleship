# Battleship
A final project for my C++ class (CIST 2361) for the game "Battleship"

The Battleship.cpp located in the battleship folder contains all code for the project.
All diagrams/planning done for the project is located in the Project Info Folder
.rap files using the RAPTOR program
All sound files have been replaced by silence due to copyright and size constraints.

I do not own any of the music in this project.
